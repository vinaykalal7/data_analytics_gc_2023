The given data is that of an automated manufacturing unit that uses 25 sensors. These
sensors record the data every minute, and after 10 minutes, the state of the manufacturing
unit is also recorded.
There are four possible states - No risk, low risk, medium risk, and catastrophic. The task is to
predict the state of the manufacturing unit after 10 minutes.

given dataset includes these columns
Sample_id: This refers to a sample of 10 minutes for which the label is given.
Time_stamp: This refers to the time at which the sample was taken. It takes values from
Twenty-five sensors: We have been given values for 25 given sensors at every minute.
There are a total of 50,000 labels for 5,50,000 minutes.
There is no missing value in the dataset.
The given dataset consists of 5,50,000 and 27 columns. The following field has been
provided in the training data set:
 1 to 10.
